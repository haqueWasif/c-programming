#include<stdio.h>

/*
i++ & ++i both increases value of i by 1
i-- & --i both decreases value of i by 1

So no difference in case of increment or decrement

But in case of assigning their values to a variable i.e,
x = i++ 
( if i=10 then at first i=10 is assigned to x then value of i becomes 11 )
(This is also called post increment)

x = ++i 
(if i=10 then at first the value of i is increases to 11 then it is assigned to x)
(This is also called pre increment)

Similarly for i-- & --i
